Background Pingu has originally been a Discord bot designed for automatic parsing of Minecraft logs, primarily for the MCSR (Minecraft Speedrunning) community. Now it's also available as a website.

## Features

- Supports paste.ee and mclo.gs links, as well as Discord attached files.
- Uploads logs to mclo.gs.
- Automatically detects lots of common issues.

## Issue detection

Issue detection was mostly made with MultiMC / Prism Launcher `Minecraft log`'s log format in mind. It will still try to find issues in latest.log's / crash-reports, but support for them is limited.

A lot of common Minecraft issues should be detected, including mod crashes, as well as some MultiMC/Prism issues.
